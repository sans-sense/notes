# notes
Each folder is a tex file along with styles used for creating a pdf, it is self contained and can be uploaded as a tar file to other TeX sites. 

To generate pdf run ```pdflatex <folder-name>.tex```. 


## Setup
We need pdflatex, which can be installed from [here](https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html), BasicTex is sufficient.   
For survival in TeX land [this](https://web.mit.edu/rsi/www/pdfs/new-latex.pdf) is handy.   
VSCode does have plugins, but it needs latexmk and perl, so living with CLI.
